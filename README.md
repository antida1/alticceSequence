# Alticce Sequence
With this exercise you can obtain a specific value or a complete list of the Alticce sequence by calling the endpoint and specifying the index of the sequence

# Execution from IntelliJ IDE:
First you need to install IntelliJ IDE import the project and run main application: SequenceApplication.java, then you can test the app ussing postman or Swagger.
**{n}** representa el Ã­ndice de la secuencia de la que queremos obtener el valor.

  1. specific value of the sequence:
  - In postman you have to create a Request of type Get, the url to test this case is: localhost:8080/alticci/*{n}* then you click send and the response body show you the number for the specific value.
  - For Swagger you need to open your browser an go to the url: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html then you can watch two endpoints, for this case you click on try  it out on the first endpoint and specific the *{n}*, then click on execute and in the response you can watch the value of this sequence.
    
  2. complete list of the Alticce sequence:
  - In postman you have to create a Request of type Get, the url to test this case is: localhost:8080/alticci/complete/*{n}* then you click send and the response body show you the number for the specific value.
  - For Swagger you need to open your browser an go to the url: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html then you can watch two endpoints, for this case you click on try  it out on the second endpoint and specific the {n}, then click on execute and in the response you can watch all this sequence.
  
# Execution from Docker:
In the root folder of the project open a console to create the image and run the next code:

  > docker build -t springbootdockeralticce .
  
Once you have the docker image, you can run it with docker run:

  > docker run  -p 8080:8080 springbootdockeralticce
  
Now you open the url pointing to the port you told docker. In this case: 8080.

Now you can access to swagger: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html or test with postman
